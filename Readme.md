## Project Vision
Our vision is to enhance virtual conference engagement through an incentivized token reward system. By providing participants with tangible value for their time and attention, this project aims to increase attendance rates and foster community involvement in virtual events.

## Key Features

1. **Custom Token Rewards**:
   - Attendees receive `ConferenceToken (CONF)` as a reward for attending conferences.

2. **ERC20-Like Token Functionality**:
   - Full support for token transfers, approvals, and allowances.

3. **Owner-Managed Rewards**:
   - The contract owner has the sole authority to distribute tokens to attendees.

4. **Transparency and Security**:
   - All token transactions and rewards are tracked on the blockchain through events.

5. **Flexible Supply**:
   - Total token supply is defined at deployment, and tokens are distributed directly by the owner.

6. **Scalability**:
   - The system can be integrated with existing virtual conference platforms for automated token rewards.

## Future Scope
- **NFT Badges**: Integrate NFT-based badges for exclusive conference rewards.
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Automate reward distribution based on attendance duration.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Enable token holders to redeem tokens for goods or services.
